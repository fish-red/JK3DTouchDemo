I have added this repository to help you utilize 3D touch Apple introduced since their introduction of iPhone6s and iPhone6s-Plus.
This is an awesome feature and I strongly recommend you to take advantage of it. It will immensly help you for future apps.

Some big organization and startups have already starter using this feature and soon there will be lot of app moving
towards it as it becomes mainstream.

####Here is the demo of my repository in the form of GIF.
